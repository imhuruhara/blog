XAI - Explainable AI
In 2010, the EU started working on legislation that eventually became GDPR (2018) that affirms privacy as a human right and must be enforceable. That brought rise to a new IT department and spurred an ecosystem of data enforcers and tools.

With the recent AI act, XAI will be an interesting space.
Move over Data Privacy enforcers, it is time for XAI-men (or women) now :)

Not bad for a government agency, actually I'm not surprised, their cloud adoption and security guidelines are almost impeccable (!) <-- given that time it was published.
