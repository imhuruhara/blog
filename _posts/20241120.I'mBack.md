Hey everyone! After a 6-month break filled with Ironman 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️training, almost struck by 
lightning ⚡during my recent UTMB Taiping and embracing a new role, I’m back and ready to dive in!

From now on, I'll be sharing posts that blend my passion for tech with my personal insights—not anything officially from Express. As the Head of Enterprise Architecture (a title that still makes me cringe a bit! 🤦‍♂️), I’m eager to explore the fascinating intersection of tech developments and real-world application.

Excited to have you followers along for the ride—stay tuned for some thought-provoking content!
