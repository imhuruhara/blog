I've recently reshaped my perception of AI in both my personal and managerial roles. Instead of viewing AI simply as a tool, I now recognize its significance as a personalized, scalable, and skillful resource. I believe it deserves acknowledgment and respect as a valuable team contributor in my life, as well as within my team and department. This shift in perspective reflects a growing awareness of the potential of AI to serve as more than just a tool but as an integral member of our workforce. It hints at the emergence of a concept akin to technological animism, where we attribute a sense of agency and value to AI systems within our professional environments.
